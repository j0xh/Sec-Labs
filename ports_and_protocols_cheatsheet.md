\ Tips

- TCP vs. UDP: TCP is connection-oriented and reliable, while UDP is connectionless and faster but less reliable.
- Ports below 1024 are considered well-known ports and are typically reserved for system or privileged services.
- Port 443 (HTTPS) is essential for secure communication over the webâ€”ensure all sensitive traffic uses it!
